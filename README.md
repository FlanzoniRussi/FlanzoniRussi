# Hello world! 👋

My name is Fabiano Lanzoni 🤓

I am a fullstack developer with over 9 years of experience in technology, holding a degree in Systems Analysis and Development. My journey in software development began in 2014, building complete and scalable solutions for various industries.

Currently, since March 2023, I have been working as a Tech Manager, leading technology teams, defining technical strategies, and contributing to delivering high-quality products that make a real impact.

In my daily work, I am always eager to learn, share knowledge, and write code that makes a difference. Feel free to explore my repositories and collaborate on projects!
